The project consists of a Sender class and a Receiver class.
	Type 'make' to compile the java programs and type 'java Receiver' on one terminal instance and 'java Sender' on another terminal instance.
		Note that it is important to run the Reciever first, before the Sender.
	Both programs print system logs of what they are doing in the background.
	In the Sender program: a message is sent every 5 seconds, you are able to type a message to encrypt and send by entering your message and pressing <Enter>.
		Note that once the 5 seconds have elapsed, the system logs will interrupt and make it seem like your input has disappeared, but the input will not be lost and the full message will still be sent once you hit <Enter>.
	Enter the message 'q' on the Sender side to terminate both the Sender and Receiver.
